      <h1>My Journey through Eloquent Javascript</h1>
      <br>
      <h3>Chapter 1 notes (Values, types, and operators)</h3>
      <p>"Below the surface of the machine, the program moves. Without effort, it expands and contracts. In great harmony, electrons scatter and regroup. The forms on the monitor are but ripples on the water. The essence stays invisibly below.""</p>
      <p>Master Yuan-Ma, The Book of Programming</p>
<br>
      <p>All programmng when broken down into its most basic form is binary: 1's and 0's</p>
      <pre>   0   0   0   0   1   1   0   1
 128  64  32  16   8   4   2   1</pre> <pre>8+4+1=13</pre>
<br>
      <h3>The Values of Javascript</h3>
        <ul>Numbers</ul>
        <ul>Strings</ul>
        <ul>Booleans</ul>
        <ul>Objects</ul>
        <ul>Functions</ul>
        <ul>Underfined Values</ul>
<br>
      <h4>Numbers</h4>
      <span>Simple enough. They, for the most part appear as numbers.</span>
      <p>"Arithmetic" "PEMDAS"</p>
      <p>Special numbers = Infinity, positive and negative. NAN = Not a number</p>
<br>
      <h4>Strings</h4>
      <span>Strings are represented via text. They are always written in enclosing quotes:</span>
      <p>Ex: "Patch my boat with chewing gum"</p>
      <p>Ex: "Monkey wave goodbye"</p>
<br>
      <span>Quotes must have a start and an end when describing text</span>
      <p>String cannot be divided, multipled, or subtracted. The "+" operator can still be used on it however</p>
      <p>Ex: "concatenate" = "con" + "cat" + "e" + "nate"</p>
<br>
      <h4>Unary Operators</h4>
      <span>Not all operators are symbols. Some are written as words</span>
      <p>Ex: Console.log(typeof 4.5)</p>
      <p>// -> number</p>
      <p>console.log(typeof "x")</p>
      <p>// -> String</p>
      <span>Operators that use two values are called binary operators, while those that take one are called unary operators</span>
      <p>Ex: Console.log(-(10-2))</p>
      <p>// -> -8</p>
<br>
      <h4>Boolean Values</h4>
      <span>When you need a value that can distinguish between two possibilities like true and false, you'll need boolean values</span>
      <p>Ex: console.log(3 > 2) This can also apply o strings</p>
      <p>// -> true</p>
      <p>console.log (3 < 2)</p>
      <p>// -> false</p>
      <p>Ex: Console.log ("Aardvark" < "Zoroaster")
      <p>// -> true</p>
      <span>Strings are ordered more or less alphabeticly. Uppercase letters are always "less" than lowercase ones</span>
<br>
      <h4>Comparisons</h4>
      <span>console.log(3 > 2)</span>
      <p>// -> true</p>
      <span>console.log(3 < 2)</span>
      <p>// -> false</p>
