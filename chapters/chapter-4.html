    <h1>DATA STRUCTURES: OBJECTS AND ARRAYS</h1>
    <p>"On two occasions I have been asked, ‘Pray, Mr. Babbage, if you put into the machine wrong figures, will the right
    answers come out?’ [...] I am not able rightly to apprehend the kind of confusion of ideas that could provoke such a
    question."</p>
    <p>Charles Babbage, Passages from the Life of a Philosopher (1864)</p>

    <h3>DATA SETS</h3>
    <p>JavaScript provides a data type specifically for storing sequences of values. It is called an array and is written as a
    list of values between square brackets, separated by commas.</p>
    <p>let listOfNumbers = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11];</p>
    <p>console.log(listOfNumbers[2]);</p>
    <p>// -> 5</p>
    <p>console.log(listOfNumbers[0]);</p>
    <p>// -> 2</p>
    <p>console.log(listOfNumbers[2 - 1]);</p>
    <p>// -> 3</p>
