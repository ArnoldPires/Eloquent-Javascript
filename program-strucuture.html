    <h1>Program Structure</h1>
    <p>"And my heart glows bright red under my filmy, translucent skin and they have to administer 10cc of JavaScript to get me to come back. (I respond well to toxins in the blood.) Man, that stuff will kick the peaches right out your gills!"</p>

    <h2>Expressions and Statments</h2>
    <p>A fragment of code that produces a value is called an expression.</p>
    <p>Every value that is written literally (such as 10 or "television") is an expression.</p>
    <p>A program is simply a list of statments</p>
    <p>The simplest kind of statment is an expression with a semicolon after it. Ex:</p>
    <p>1;</p>
    <p>!false;</p>
<br>
    <h3>Variables</h3>
    <p>In order for your program to remember things, it needs to be placed and held into a value. Holding these values is called a "variable."</p>
    <p>Ex: var caught = 5 * 5;</p>
    <p>Adding "var" indicates that we are writing out a variable, the rest is just, what are we naming the varible. The name can be anything we want it to be.</p>
    <p>Ex:</p>
    <p>var ten = 10;</p>
    <p>console.log(ten * ten);</p>
    <p>// -> 100</p>
<br>
    <span>Just because you've named a variable, doesn't mean that varible's name is the end all be all. The "=" operator can be used to disconnect the name of the variable value and have it pointed to another one.</span>
    <p>Ex:</p>
    <p>var mood = "light";</p>
    <p>console.log(mood);</p>
    <p>// -> light</p>
    <p>mood = "dark";</p>
    <p>console.log(mood);</p>
    <p>// -> dark</p>
