    <h1>Program Structure</h1>
    <p>"And my heart glows bright red under my filmy, translucent skin and they have to administer 10cc of JavaScript to get me to come back. (I respond well to toxins in the blood.) Man, that stuff will kick the peaches right out your gills!"</p>

<br>
    <h2>Expressions and Statments</h2>
    <p>A fragment of code that produces a value is called an expression.</p>
    <p>Every value that is written literally (such as 10 or "television") is an expression.</p>
    <p>A program is simply a list of statments</p>
    <p>The simplest kind of statment is an expression with a semicolon after it. Ex:</p>
    <p>1;</p>
    <p>!false;</p>
<br>
    <h3>Variables</h3>
    <p>In order for your program to remember things, it needs to be placed and held into a value. Holding these values is called a "variable."</p>
    <p>Ex: var caught = 5 * 5;</p>
    <p>Adding "var" indicates that we are writing out a variable, the rest is just, what are we naming the varible. The name can be anything we want it to be.</p>
    <p>Ex:</p>
    <p>var ten = 10;</p>
    <p>console.log(ten * ten);</p>
    <p>// -> 100</p>
    <button id="tenex">Click me to see example</button>
<br>
    <span>Just because you've named a variable, doesn't mean that varible's name is the end all be all. The "=" operator can be used to disconnect the name of the variable value and have it pointed to another one.</span>
    <p>Ex:</p>
    <p>var mood = "light";</p>
    <p>console.log(mood);</p>
    <p>// -> light</p>
    <p>mood = "dark";</p>
    <p>console.log(mood);</p>
    <p>// -> dark</p>
<br>
    <p>Ex:</p>
    <p>var arnoldsDebt = 140;</p>
    <p>arnoldsDebt = arnoldsDebt - 35;</p>
    <p>console.log(arnoldsDebt);</p>
    <p>// -> 105</p>
<br>
    <span>A single var statement may define multiple variables. The definitions must be separated by commas</span>
    <p>Ex:</p>
    <p>var one = 1, two = 2;</p>
    <p>console.log(one + two);</p>
    <p>// -> 3</p>
<br>
    <h3>Keywords and reserved words</h3>
    <span>Full list of keywords that can be used to describe different variables:</span>
    <p>break, case, catch, class, const, continue, debugger, default, delete, do, else, enum, export, extends, false, finally, for, function, if, implements, import, in, instanceof, interface, let, new, null, package, private, protected, public, return, static, super, switch, this, throw, true, try, typeof, var, void, while, with, yield.</p>
<br>
    <h3>Functions</h3>
    <span>A function is a piece of program wrapped in a value</span>
    <p>Ex:</p>
    <p>alert("Good morning!");</p>
    <p>Executing a function is called "invoking," "calling," or "applying" it.</p>
    <p>Values given to functions are called arguments.</p>
<br>
    <p>confirm("Shall we, then");</p>
    <p>prompt("Tell me everything you know.", "...");</p>
<br>
    <h3>Control Flow</h3>
    <span>Some programs can contain more than one statement, Ex:</span>
    <button id="clickMe">Click me to show exmaple</button>
